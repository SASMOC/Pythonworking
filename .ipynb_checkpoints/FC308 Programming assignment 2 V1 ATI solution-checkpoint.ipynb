    "### The program plays a game of Hangman with the user by randomly choosing a word from a list of words and displaying dashes for each letter of the word. The user guesses letters, one at a time, to try to guess the secret word. If the user guesses a letter in the secret word, that letter replaces the dash in the correct position. If the user guesses a letter that does not appear in the secret word, the program reduces the number of incorrect guesses available by one. If the user correctly guesses all the letters in the word, the user wins the game. Otherwise, when the user runs out of incorrect guesses, the program wins. After each game, the user has the option to play again."
